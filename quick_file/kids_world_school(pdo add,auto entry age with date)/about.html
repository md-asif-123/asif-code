                <h2 class="MainHeading">At School<span></span></h2>
                <p>Most children with epilepsy attend school and can participate in all activities. Some may need to take medicine at school, help with certain subjects, or extra time on tests. They may sometimes have seizures at school. With more than 300,000 school-age children who have epilepsy in the United States, none of this is that unusual. Yet there's a good chance that many of your child's teachers and classmates won't know much about epilepsy. Educating them is one of the most important things you can do to help your child at school.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="TextGroup">
                <h2 class="MainHeading">Teach Your School About Epilepsy and Seizures<span></span></h2>
                <p>Start each school year by scheduling a meeting with your child's teacher. Discuss your child's condition, any learning issues and how to respond if your child has a seizure. Ask if there are others at the school you should talk to or give information to, such as gym teachers, school nurses, the librarian, etc. Keep in touch with them through the school year about your child's progress, changes in medication and any related issues.</p>
                <p>Ask your teacher to discuss epilepsy with the class in a way that is appropriate for the age level and that would be comfortable for your child. Having a seizure at school can be embarrassing for a child and frightening for others. It is better if the teacher discussed it with the students beforehand. Talking to students about epilepsy can help prevent teasing and correct some of the inaccuracies children may have heard. Offer to provide books and other materials the teacher can use. Review the Get Involved section of this website for ideas.</p>

                <h2 class="MainHeading">Learning Issues<span></span></h2>
                <p>While most children with epilepsy test in the "average" I.Q. range, they are more likely than others to have learning problems that affect how well they do in school. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:</p>
                <p>Side effects from medication that make a child tired or drowsy
                    Frequently missing school for medical appointments
                    Regularly "blanking out" due to absence seizures, which sometimes are not recognized or diagnosed for a long time
                    Worry or anxiety about having a seizure
                    Attention disorders
                    Problems with memory and learning in the part of the brain where the seizure occurs</p>
                 <p>If you are aware of these potential problems, you can work with teachers on possible solutions. Ask the teacher to let you know if your child seems unusually tired, to send home work your child missed and to keep you posted on how your child is doing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="TextGroup">
                <h2 class="MainHeading">Support<span></span></h2>
                <p>Most teachers and schools want to help children with special needs. They want to make sure they understand how epilepsy affects a child and what to do if a child has a seizure. Try to work with them as partners. Show appreciation for their work, give them information that could help them understand your child's needs and encourage your child to complete assignments.
</p>
                <p>If epilepsy affects your child's ability to learn, you are probably entitled to special education services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal law that says every child with a disability is entitled to a free, appropriate education in the least restrictive (most "normal") setting possible. Your local Epilepsy Foundation should be able to tell you about laws and services in your state.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="TextGroup">
                <h2 class="MainHeading">Daycare Options<span></span></h2>
                <p>If your child is in day care, you will want to work with the caregivers to make sure they understand what epilepsy is and how to handle a seizure. Visit this website's Living with Epilepsy section for information and tools you can use.
</p>
                <p>Parents of infants and toddlers with epilepsy sometimes have a hard time finding child care while they work. Most day care centers and pre-schools are not public or run by the government. Many are private businesses, with each one setting many of its own rules and policies. Some have used this independence to deny admission to children with epilepsy or to refuse to give them emergency antiseizure medication. The Epilepsy Foundation has joined lawsuits against centers that refuse to give children emergency medication, noting that the medication requires no medical training to administer and could save a child's life. If you feel that your child has been denied access to child care or services, you can file a complaint with the United States Department of Justice or file a lawsuit. For assistance with legal issues, contact the Jeanne A Carpenter Epilepsy Legal Defense Fund.</p>
